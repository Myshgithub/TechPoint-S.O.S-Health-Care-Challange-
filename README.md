# TechPoint-S.O.S-Health-Care-Challange
Health Care-Team5
# Goal: Provide Better Health Care guidance to Patients as core of the System using Blockchain Technology
Provide better Health care service and data management to patients using Blockchain Technology 
(Considered 3 related Scenarios)

# Scenarios of using blockchain in different healthcare settings: 

All different but related scenarios can be as follow:
Scenario 1: Primary patient care; 
Scenario 2: Data aggregation for the research purposes and incentive the patient for sharing the data; 
Scenario 3: Connecting different healthcare players for better patient care; 
Better means: By employing blockchain technology, our solution allows to facilitate the consent management and speed up data transfer. We developed a chaincode that allows a patient to easily impose fine-grained access control policy for his data and enables efficient data sharing among clinicians/ Health care providers.
Senario 4: Remote Health System for Patient Monitoring.
Senario 5: Digital Passport as response to Covid-19

# Name of Proposed Product:  Provide better Health care guidance to patients

# Some Product Goals:
Provide better Health care guidance to patients- including Scenario 1: Primary patient care
What Better means in our Product/ Application are as follows:
-providing accountability of access, maintaining the complete and updated information with a verifiable record of the provenance, including all accesses/sharing/usages of the data.
-It supports privacy-preserving data sharing and management
-Motivate users/patients to be part of the research by building up incentives for users to share their profile data, in terms of rewards (micro-payments or credits). In this way, users become owners of their data and can decide how their data is collected and used, as well as shared.

# Product Specification:

- A blockchain-based records system would empower patients to retain full control over their data, choosing when, and to whom, to grant permission to access their information.

- Capable of storing and managing patient information in a verifiable manner, publicly accessible in real-time by anyone in the healthcare service provider chain (if authorized by the patient)

-Provide an up-to-date, comprehensive picture of patient health, enabling physicians, pharmacies and other providers to provide better health care guidance to patients.
